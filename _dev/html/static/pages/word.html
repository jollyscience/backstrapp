                    HomeownerSupport.com grew from an effort we started 12 months ago to help homeowners who are worried about losing their homes. Since then, we've sent invitations to more than 30,000 CitiMortgage customers in 25 cities who were struggling with their mortgage payments. We invited these customers to visit us&mdash;in person, at a special event in their town. Our customers sat with Citi's Homeowner Support Specialists and worked to identify their best options in straightforward, one-on-one conversations.

                    We call this program Road to Recovery, and it's off to a great start. Most of the times we start working with a customer, we're able to help find a solution. In fact, we've been able to help many homeowners with meaningful mortgage payment assistance. But I'm also keenly aware of what we've learned: the number of people who want simple, candid help, but have been frustrated trying to understand their options and what they need to do. Many others need help but are hesitant to contact us. They need information and support, too.

                    We hope HomeownerSupport.com will help address these issues. Whether you're a CitiMortgage customer or not, this is a place to get help for your unique situation. It's a place to get information, engage in dialogue, and perhaps even help others by sharing your experiences. Sometimes that information will come from us. Other times from industry experts. It may also come from the best of what social networking and communities can provide: others who are going&mdash;or have gone&mdash;through the same challenges you face. Someone who has been where you are now.

                    Homeowners facing difficult times often ask me: What should I do? My most important message is the one you'll find on nearly every page of this site: contact your mortgage company&mdash;start the dialogue early. Explain your situation. Ask for help

                    I'm aware that some people see banks as a part of the problem. You may have asked for assistance and you may have found the process to be confusing or frustrating. This is something we are committed to fixing.

                    But while we're doing that, we also wanted to create this online environment, where homeowners can get information from other homeowners. Where helpful information and links are prominent. And where asking a question can get an answer.
