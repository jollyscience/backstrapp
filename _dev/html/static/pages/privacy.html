                    Generally, a cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place on Your computer when You visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience.  Some cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on Your computer until You delete them.

                    CitiMortgage uses cookies for a number of purposes&mdash;for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of the Site for research and other purposes, to store Your preferences for certain kinds of information, or to store a user name or identification number so that You do not have to provide this information every time You return to the Site. Your browser software may contain a feature intended to notify You of the cookie policies of the Websites You visit. For example, the browser software contained in certain operating systems may contain a cookie-filtering device commonly known as P3P. General information about P3P can be found at <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P" class="speedBump_link">www.w3.org/P3P</a>. P3P is still evolving. Therefore, We are not responsible for problems You may experience using a P3P filter or discrepancies between the machine-coded privacy statements that are read by the P3P tool and Our human readable policies referenced here, including this privacy statement which is the information to which You should refer if You have questions about Your privacy regarding this Site.  You can decide if and how Your computer will accept a cookie by configuring Your preferences or options in Your browser.  However, if You choose to reject cookies, You may not be able to use certain parts of the Site.

The companies We use may not use these cookies for their own purposes or share the information gathered with others, in accordance with the terms of the contracts they have signed with Us.
