				<p>If you're facing foreclosure and you're open to the idea of selling your home, a short sale may be the best option for you.</p>
				<h3>How a short sale works</h3>
				<p>A short sale is when you sell your house for less than what you owe on your mortgage. Your mortgage company agrees to accept the money you sell your house for&mdash;even though this amount is less than what you owe on your loan&mdash;and still consider your mortgage (or a portion of it) paid off.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of a short sale include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Paying off your mortgage for less than what you currently owe.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Listing your home at a competitive price so it can sell more quickly.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Avoiding foreclosure.</span></li>
                </ul>
		    <h3>Are you eligible for a short sale?</h3>
				<p>A short sale may be a good option for you if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're willing to sell your home so you can move on and make a fresh start.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage is "under water" or "upside down," meaning you owe more than your home is worth.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're experiencing a long-term hardship.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">You're behind on your mortgage payments.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">You haven't qualified for a mortgage modification.</span></li>
				</ul>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>Call your mortgage company to see if a short sale can work given your situation. To save time, gather this information before you call:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
