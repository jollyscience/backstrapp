				<p>Maybe you need help because your financial circumstances have permanently changed and you can't afford your mortgage payments anymore. If your mortgage company can't refinance your mortgage, they may be able to make your payments more affordable with a mortgage modification.</p>
				<h3>How a mortgage modification works</h3>
				<p>If you qualify for a mortgage modification, the terms of your mortgage will permanently change to make it more manageable for your financial situation.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><span class="color-reset">This could involve changing the length of your mortgage term, the type of interest rate you have or the interest rate itself.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">You may wind up with a lower monthly mortgage payment.</span></li>
<li><span class="color-reset">Your account will be brought up to date so you can have a fresh start on payments.</span></li>
<li><span class="color-reset">Any overdue amount and escrow is added onto the new unpaid principal balance and distributed over the life of the loan.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
		    <h3>Are you eligible for a loan modification?</h3>
				<p>The requirements for getting a loan modification vary depending on the exact type of modification. Ask your mortgage company about a mortgage modification if the following apply to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're experiencing a long-term financial hardship due to circumstances such as divorce, reduced income, disability or serious illness.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're behind on your mortgage payments or you're likely to fall behind soon.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">You don't qualify for refinancing.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>If you feel like you can't afford your mortgage, it's definitely time to contact your mortgage company. Waiting too long can reduce your chances of finding a solution for your situation.</p>
                <p>Gather this information before you call to talk about a mortgage modification:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>When you talk to your representative, explain your financial situation and why you can't afford your mortgage. This will help identify options that may be available to you.</p>
