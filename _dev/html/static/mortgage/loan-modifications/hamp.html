				<p>Many homeowners simply can't afford their mortgages anymore because they're going through a long-term financial hardship. The U.S. government created HAMP to help these homeowners get into more affordable mortgages so they can stay in their homes.</p>
				<h3>How HAMP works</h3>
				<p>HAMP lowers your monthly mortgage payment to 31% of your monthly gross (pre-tax) income. Through HAMP, the terms of your existing mortgage will change and your account will be brought up to date as soon as the modification is finalized. Here's how the HAMP process works:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><span class="color-reset">If your mortgage company says you qualify for HAMP, they'll send you a packet with some forms you'll need to fill out, sign and submit.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">After you've been approved, you'll start a three-month HAMP trial period. During this period, you'll make your new, lower mortgage payments.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Upon successfully completing the trial period, you'll receive a final Modification Agreement to sign and your mortgage will be permanently modified.</span></li>
                </ul>
		    <h3>Are you eligible for HAMP?</h3>
				<p>You may be eligible for HAMP if all of the following apply to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're facing a long-term financial hardship due to circumstances such as divorce, reduced income, disability or serious illness.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">You're behind on your mortgage payments or will be soon.</span></li>
<li><span class="color-reset">Your home is your primary residence.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">Your existing mortgage was originated on or before January 1, 2009.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage payment is more than 31% of your monthly income before taxes and other deductions.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">You don't owe more than $729,750 on your home.</span></li>
<li><span class="color-reset">You'll be able to afford the modified payment every month.</span></li>
<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage company participates in the Home Affordable Modification Program. <a href="http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/get-assistance/contact-mortgage/Pages/default.aspx">Find out here.</a></span></li>
				</ul>
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>First, contact your mortgage company and ask about HAMP. To save time, have the following documents handy before you call:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
