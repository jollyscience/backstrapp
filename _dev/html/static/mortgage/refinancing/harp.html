				<p>If you don't qualify for refinancing because your home went down in value or you can't get mortgage insurance, you may be able to refinance under HARP. HARP is the only refinance program that gives homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth a way to enjoy low interest rates, a more stable mortgage and other refinancing benefits.</p>
				<h3>How HARP works</h3>
				<p>HARP would be a new loan, so it has its own  application and underwriting process, much like when you got your original  mortgage.</p>
		    <h3>Are you eligible for HARP?</h3>
				<p>You may be eligible for HARP if all of the following apply to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You have a mortgage that is owned or  guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage payments are up to date  with no late payments in the past six months.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You haven't been more than 30 days late (two consecutive missed payments) in the  past 12 months.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You do not have a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan or U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Your home's current loan-to-value (LTV)  ratio is more than 80%. In other words, the remaining balance of your mortgage  is at least 80% of the value of your home.</span></li>
                  <li><span class="color-reset">You'll  be able to afford the new payments.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">The refinance will make your mortgage more affordable or stable in the long term.</span></li>
                    
                    </ul>

<p>An important note: these criteria are for guidance only and you'll need to contact your mortgage company to find out if you qualify for HARP. </p>
				
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>First,  make sure your mortgage is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. You can use these simple lookup  tools or call your mortgage company to find out:</p>
            	<ul>
                    <li><span class="color-reset"><a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/loanlookup/" class="speedBump_link">Fannie Mae Loan Lookup</a></span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset"><a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/corporate/" class="speedBump_link">Freddie Mac Loan Lookup</a></span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>If your mortgage is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, call your mortgage representative and ask about HARP. You can save time by having this information handy before you call:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
                </ul>
<p>When you talk to a mortgage representative, be sure to share details about your financial situation and why you're worried about making future payments. This could open up doors to more potential solutions.</p>
