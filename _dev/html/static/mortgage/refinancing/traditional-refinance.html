				<p>Maybe you have an adjustable rate mortgage and worry about your payment increasing. Or maybe you're just struggling to keep up with payments at your current interest rate. Either way, traditional refinancing may be a good option if you're paying your mortgage on time now but you're concerned about making payments in the future.</p>
				<h3>How refinancing works</h3>
				<p>Refinancing means you replace your current mortgage with a new mortgage under different terms. Your new mortgage may be more affordable and/or stable:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><span class="color-reset">If you have a fixed rate now, you may be able to get a lower interest rate or extend the repayment term. This can reduce your monthly mortgage payments.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">If you have an  introductory rate that will go up or if you&rsquo;re facing a balloon payment,  refinancing into a lower rate could save you money on the amount of interest  you pay throughout the mortgage term.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">If you have an adjustable rate mortgage, locking into a fixed rate will make your monthly payments more steady and manageable.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you qualify for refinancing, you'll go through a process similar to when you got your original mortgage. There will be an application, approval and closing process. 
                 </p>
		    <h3>Are you eligible for traditional refinancing?</h3>
				<p>Here are a couple of general qualifications for refinancing through a mortgage company:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage payments need to be up to date.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You need to have built up at least 10% equity in your home</span></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>First, contact your mortgage company as soon as possible. You can save time by gathering this information before you call:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You should also be ready to explain your current financial situation and why you're concerned about making your mortgage payments.</p>
