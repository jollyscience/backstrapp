				<p>If you're struggling because of a temporary hardship, your lender may agree to lower your mortgage payments for a period of time. This is called a deferment, which is also known as forbearance.</p>
				<h3>How deferment works</h3>
				<p>With this option, your mortgage company agrees to temporarily reduce your monthly mortgage payments for a set period of time. You'll have to make these payments later, but at least you'll have a bit of time to get back on your feet while your short-term financial problems pass. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage representative will specify the length of your deferment, the amount you'll have to pay during this period (if any), and how the deferred amount will be repaid.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">After the deferment period ends, you'll pay back the amount that was suspended or reduced. This can be done by making one lump-sum payment or by adding the monthly payments onto the end of your mortgage term.</span></li>
</ul>
		    <h3>Are you eligible for deferment?</h3>
				<p>Deferment may be an option for you if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You've missed multiple mortgage payments.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're dealing with a temporary financial hardship due to unexpected expenses such as medical bills or home repairs you haven't been reimbursed for yet.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">You don't qualify for refinancing or you don't want to refinance.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>If you think deferment could help your situation, contact your mortgage company. Have the following information ready to save time:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You'll also need to discuss your current circumstances and why you're behind on your mortgage payments. The more your mortgage representative understands your situation, the more likely they'll be able to find a solution for you.</p>
