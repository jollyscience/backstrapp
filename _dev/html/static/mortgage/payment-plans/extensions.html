				<p>If you're behind on one or two mortgage payments because you were going through a short-term financial hardship that is now over, an extension may bring your account up to date.</p>
				<h3>How an extension works</h3>
				<p>An extension is designed for homeowners who experienced a temporary hardship that is now resolved. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Your lender agrees to move the payments you missed to the end of your mortgage term, usually a maximum of two months per extension.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">Your account will be considered up to date.</span></li>
                <li><span class="color-reset">You mortgage term will be extended to include the payments you missed.</span></li>
                </ul>
				<h3>Are you eligible for an extension?</h3>
				<p>Here are some general eligibility criteria for an extension:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You experienced a temporary financial hardship that has been resolved.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You've made one full mortgage payment within 30 days of requesting the extension.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're no more than two payments behind on your mortgage.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="color-reset">You'll be able to make your regularly scheduled mortgage payments for the extended term of your mortgage.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>If you're behind on mortgage payments, contact your mortgage company as soon as possible. If you don't qualify for an extension, there may be another solution available.</p><p>Before you call, save time by gathering this information:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You'll also need to explain the hardship that kept you from making your mortgage payments. The more information you can provide, the better.</p>
