				<p>If a temporary financial hardship caused you to fall behind on your mortgage payments, a repayment plan may help you catch up. </p>
				<h3>How a repayment plan works</h3>
				<p>With a repayment plan, a portion of your missed mortgage payments will be added onto your regularly scheduled payment each month. This way you can gradually pay off any past due amounts and bring your account up to date within a specified time frame, generally in less than 12 months. The exact time frame will depend on the past due amount, how much you can afford to pay every month and other factors.</p>
				<h3>Are you eligible for a repayment plan?</h3>
				<p>Here are some basic eligibility criteria for a repayment plan:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You're at least one payment behind on your mortgage.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">Your financial hardship must be temporary. This could include car repair expenses, a change in your job, out-of-pocket medical expenses and more.</span></li>
					<li><span class="color-reset">You'll be able to afford your monthly mortgage payment plus your repayment plan. This means every month you'll need to make your regular mortgage payments, plus whatever additional amount is necessary to pay off your past due amount.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<p>First things first: Contact your mortgage company as soon as possible and ask about repayment plan options. You can save time by gathering this information before you call:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your mortgage statement and other loan information such as payments and balances of second mortgages, automobiles or student loans.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Copies of your two most recent pay stubs showing your year-to-date earnings.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, your most recent Quarterly or Year-to-Date Profit/Loss statement.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Your most recent personal checking, savings, money market, mutual funds, stock and bond statements.</span></li>
				<li><span class="color-reset">Recent tax returns.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Be ready to explain your current hardship and why you're having trouble making your mortgage payments. The more your mortgage representative understands your situation, the more likely they'll be able to find a solution for you.</p>
