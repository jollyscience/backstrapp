      <title>Why did my mortgage lender sell my loan?</title>
      <link>https://community.homeownersupport.com/community/forums/blog/2012/01/10/why-did-my-mortgage-lender-sell-my-loan</link>

      <description>&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyStart:36ec7eb1-4823-469f-be76-578ab23136a6] --&gt;&lt;div class="jive-rendered-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, the mortgage industry was a lot simpler than it is today. Back then, if you wanted a mortgage to buy a home, you'd visit your local bank or savings &amp;amp; loan. You'd apply, and if approved, your lender would keep that mortgage on its books for the life of the loan. You'd make your payments to the same lender month after month until the loan was paid in full. It was easy and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mortgage lenders still operate exactly like that, for &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of the mortgage loans they originate. For example, Citi keeps many of the mortgages we originate. By &lt;em&gt;originate&lt;/em&gt;, we mean that the home buyer applied, received approval and closed a mortgage through us. By keeping the mortgage on our books we retain the servicing of the loan and process the payments the borrower sends us every month. However, the majority of mortgages originated no longer work this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who buys mortgages and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the majority of mortgages are sold to loan investors after origination. Some loan investors will no doubt be familiar to you, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) established by Congress to provide more money for mortgage originators to lend. In fact, Fannie Mae was originally created in 1938 at the height of the Great Depression, to help make home ownership more affordable for more Americans. That mission continues today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are private loan investors as well, which purchase pools of mortgages called mortgage backed securities (MBS). Mutual funds, pension funds and other types of private investors buy these loans with the plan to earn a fair return on their investment. Again, these purchases free up capital for the mortgage originator to loan to other home buyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private investors, there would be far less money to lend at affordable interest rates. And far fewer Americans would have the opportunity to own a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servicing retained vs. released? What does it mean to me? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways mortgage loans are sold to investors. It may be that your loan gets sold, but the servicing stays with the company that originated your loan, or both the loan and servicing could be sold at the same time. Here is a rundown of the two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"&gt;1.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Servicing Retained&lt;/span&gt;: If you're still making payments to the same lender that originated your mortgage, there's some chance that your loan is still on that lender's books. But it's far more likely that the mortgage originator sold your loan to a GSE or private investor, and retained the servicing. By retaining servicing, the mortgage lender becomes the loan servicer and manages all account activity on behalf of the investor. Loan servicing includes mortgage activity such as processing monthly payments, crediting interest and principal payments, and paying taxes and insurance if there is an escrow account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"&gt;2.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Servicing Released&lt;/span&gt;: If you originated your loan with a different lender than who you currently make payments to, then servicing was sold at some point. Servicing can be sold with the loan or it can be sold separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your loan, servicing, or both are sold you will receive notice from your lender in the mail. If the servicing is sold, your current lender will provide contact information for the new servicer and information about where to send your mortgage payments. Typically, the new servicer also sends out a welcome letter as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why my mortgage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to sell a mortgage is strictly a business decision. It is not a reflection on you, nor does it mean that the current lender doesn't value your business. The decision has one purpose: to make home ownership affordable for as many people as possible.

      <title>Welcome Post from Sanjiv Das</title>
      <link>https://community.homeownersupport.com/community/forums/blog/2011/12/16/homeownersupportcom-welcome-post-from-sanjiv-das</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyStart:b97f1ef0-0757-4d1b-bbfe-102351d1d6f3] --&gt;&lt;div class="jive-rendered-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the head of CitiMortgage, I know how difficult the past several years have been, with many Americans struggling to make their mortgage payments. It's a complicated problem &amp;ndash; unless you&amp;rsquo;re a struggling homeowner. Then it's very straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need solutions to help you stay in your home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HomeownerSupport.com grew from an effort we started 12 months ago to help homeowners who are worried about losing their homes. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve sent invitations to more than 30,000 CitiMortgage customers in 25 cities who were struggling with their mortgage payments. We invited these customers to visit us &amp;ndash; in person, at a special event in their town. Our customers sat with Citi's Homeowner Support Specialists and worked to identify their best options in straightforward, one-on-one conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call this program Road to Recovery, and it's off to a great start. Most of the times we start working with a customer, we&amp;rsquo;re able to help find a solution. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to help many homeowners with meaningful mortgage payment assistance. But I'm also keenly aware of what we've learned: the number of people who want simple, candid help, but have been frustrated trying to understand their options and what they need to do. Many others need help but are hesitant to contact us. They need information and support, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope HomeownerSupport.com will help address these issues. Whether you're a CitiMortgage customer or not, this is a place to get help for your unique situation. It&amp;rsquo;s a place to get information, engage in dialogue, and perhaps even help others by sharing your experiences. Sometimes that information will come from us. Other times from industry experts. It may also come from the best of what social networking and communities can provide: others who are going &amp;ndash; or have gone &amp;ndash; through the same challenges you face. Someone who has been where you are now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeowners facing difficult times often ask me: What should I do? My most important message is the one you'll find on nearly every page of this site: contact your mortgage company &amp;ndash; start the dialogue early. Explain your situation. Ask for help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that some people see banks as a part of the problem. You may have asked for assistance and you may have found the process to be confusing or frustrating. This is something we are committed to fixing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while we&amp;rsquo;re doing that, we also wanted to create this online environment, where homeowners can get information from other homeowners. Where helpful information and links are prominent. And where asking a question can get an answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for visiting HomeownerSupport.com. I hope you find it useful. Please let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="min-height: 8pt; height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjiv Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:b97f1ef0-0757-4d1b-bbfe-102351d1d6f3] --&gt;</description>
